## Discrete units in the continuous speech signal

![From @meyer2018neural.](assets/multilevel.jpg)

::: {.notes}
- We are focusing on one of the first and most critical steps in language acquisition: chunking the continuous speech stream into discrete, linguistically relevant units.
:::

## The syllable: a privileged linguistic unit?

Newborns (and adults) preferentially parse the speech signal into [syllable-sized units]{style="background-color: #e3e1e1;"} [e.g, @bijeljac19934; @flo2022sleeping; @luo2007phase; @jusczyk1987representation; @bertoncini1988investigation]

::: {.notes}
- Syllables seem to be specially important during the first stages of language acquisition
- Newborns preferentially parse speech into syllables (as opposed to individual phonemes, words, or phrases)
- What makes syllables so special?

:::

::: {.notes}
- The universal structure of a syllable is made of three elements
- A mandatory nucleus: this is a high-sonority speech sound (predominantly a vowel)
- Perhaps an onset, made of one or more consonants
- Perhaps a coda, made of one or more consonant

- Not all syllabic structures are possible in all languages
- Some languages impose stricter phonotactical constraints on the specific sounds and number of sounds that can occur at onset or coda

## Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)

Can you chunk this word into syllables?

> /likla/

. . .

::: box

Consonants are preferably grouped at syllabic onset
:::

* [MOP+]{style="background-color: #ea6212; color: white"}: CV.CCV - /mo.pla/
* [MOP-]{style="background-color: #781478; color: white"}: CVC.CV - /mop.la/

::: {.notes}
- However, some constraints to syllabic structure seem to be universal
- Universal: most, if not all languages, show a preference for following some specific constraints
- The aim of this project is to investigate the possible role of these universals as an early mechanism for syllabification

# Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)

Research line 1

## Study 1: are newborns sensitive to (violations of) the MOP?

::: box
Consonants are preferably grouped at syllable onset.
:::

* [MOP+]{style="background-color: #ea6212; color: white"}: CV.CCV - /li.kla/  
* [MOP-]{style="background-color: #781478; color: white"}: CVC.CV - /lik.la/

::: {.notes}
- The first universal we will investigate is the Maximal Onset Principle (MOP)
- This principle states that "consonants" are preferably grouped at syllable onset
- This principle constrains the position of syllabic boundaries
- If neonates are sensitive to violations of the MOP, it would suggest that they might be using the MOP to syllabify the speech signal from birth
:::


## Participants

* Hearing, full term neonates (fNIRS) and 6-10 mo infants (fNIRS + behavioural)
* Born/living in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (Spain)
* Mostly Catalan and/or Spanish linguistic background

::: {.notes}
- We will run an experimental series that involves neonates and infants
- Neonates will be tested using fNIRS, while infants will be tested using fNIRS and behavioural tasks (like the HeadTurn Preference Procedure)
- I will focus on the fNIRS testing of neonates and infants, as they follow the same task design
- Ideally, we'd like to test up to 50 participants per experiment, although power analysis is pending
- Most of our participants will have a Catalan and/or Spanish background
:::


## fNIRS setup

* NIRSport2 (NIRx), CW 760 nm & 850 nm
* Sampling frequency 20.345 Hz (~0.05 s samples)
* NIRScap: 8 channels LH, 8 channels RH
* ROIs: L and R temporal regions
* Crib testing in neonates, parents' lap in infants (watching cartoons)
* MNE-NIRS (Python): (1) OD, (2) motion correction (TDDR), (3) band-pass filtering, (4) block segmentation, (5) block averaging, (6) block rejection, (7) participant rejection.
